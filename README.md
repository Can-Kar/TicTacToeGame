# TicTacToeGame

A basic TicTacToe game written in C#. It works fine if user enters input accordingly. I have not added exception handling. Just wanted to make a quick and simple(!) game. There are redundant code snippets and duplicated code blocks but overall i think it doest what it should. 

(Please consider that this is my first project that i wrote with C# all my own so i definitely wrote some unnecessary code blocks but in the end this was just an exercise.)
